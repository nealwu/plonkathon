general thoughts on FFT presentation:
* what is FFT (conversion between monomial basis <=> Lagrange basis)
* why do we want to do that? multiplication and division are super easy in Lagrange basis, you just multiply / divide element-wise
* how does it work? FFT is an n log n divide and conquer algorithm; much faster than obvious n^2 algorithm
* in particular we use roots of unity, evaluate polynomial at each of those values
* however don't overuse FFT when you don't need it and can handle with O(n) algorithms instead
